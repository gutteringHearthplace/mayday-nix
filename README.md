Heyo! I'm Morgan Mayday, this is my customized NixOS config. Version number: 0.1.0

### Auto-Setup
Run `RUNME.sh`. This is _not recommended_ if you have an existing config, it _will_ overwrite your user account and `.bashrc` & I don't use Home Manager so things might get fucky.
### Manual Setup
Read `RUNME.sh` and do it step by step. If you have an existing config, copying your user over is recommended, and if you have anything in your `.bashrc` you care about please please save it.
### Tips & Tricks
`/modules/` is used to load packages.
